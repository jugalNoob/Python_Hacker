Q what is Bug Hunting ?
Ans:: Bug hunting also know as ethical hacking or vulnerability discovery is the process of actively
searaching for security vulnearebilites software bugs and weaknesses in computer system , applications , networks 
and other digital environment

2::Bug hunting, also known as vulnerability hunting or security testing, is the process of actively searching 
for vulnerabilities in software, websites, applications, or systems. The goal of bug hunting is to identify weaknesses 
that could be exploited by malicious actors or cause operational issues, 
thereby compromising the security, functionality, or reliability of the target.

Types of Vulnerabilities: Bug hunters look for a wide range of vulnerabilities, including but not limited to:
Cross-site scripting (XSS)
SQL injection
Authentication and authorization flaws
Remote code execution
Denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities
Information disclosure issues

Q what is Pen testing ?
Ans:: --> Penetration testing often  abbreviated as pen testing is a controlled and systematic 
apparoch to evaluating the security of computer system applicvation network or infrasture by simulating real world attacks 
the primary goal of penetration testing is to identify vulnerabilities , weaknesses and potential ;

1::penetration 


Q pen testing  vs BUG Hunter 

Penetration Testing (Pen Testing):

Purpose: Penetration testing, often shortened to "pen testing," is a methodical approach to testing the security
of a system or network by simulating an attack from a malicious actor.

Methodology: Pen testers follow a structured methodology that typically involves identifying vulnerabilities in systems,
networks, or applications. They attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities to assess the potential impact and likelihood of
a successful attack.

Scope: Pen testing can be broad or focused, depending on the goals. It may involve testing specific applications, 
infrastructure components, or the entire network environment.

Goal: The primary goal of pen testing is to uncover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by real attackers and provide
recommendations for improving security defenses.

Bug Hunting (or Bug Bounty Hunting):------------------------<><><><><><>
Purpose: Bug hunting, sometimes referred to as "bug bounty hunting" when done through organized programs, involves actively
searching for security vulnerabilities in software, websites, or systems.

Methodology: Bug hunters often use a combination of automated tools and manual techniques to discover vulnerabilities. They may 
explore both known and unknown attack vectors to find weaknesses.

Scope: Bug hunting can be more open-ended than pen testing and often focuses on specific applications or platforms. Bug hunters
may participate in bug bounty programs where they receive rewards for reporting valid vulnerabilities.

Goal: The main goal of bug hunting is to identify and report vulnerabilities to the organization or developer responsible for the 
system. Bug hunters can help improve overall security by finding issues that might have been missed during regular security testing.


Key Differences:--------------------<><><><><><><>
Approach: Pen testing follows a structured methodology, while bug hunting can be more flexible and creative.

Incentives: Bug hunters may receive financial rewards through bug bounty programs, whereas pen testers are typically employed
by organizations or hired for specific engagements.

Focus: Pen testing is about comprehensive security assessment, while bug hunting is focused on finding specific vulnerabilities
for reporting and sometimes monetary rewards.


Q what is Cookies?

Ans: 
ChatGPT
Cookies are small pieces of data that websites store on a user's device (typically in the web browser) to remember 
information about the user or track their activities across different sessions or websites. Here are some key points about cookies:

Purpose: Cookies serve several purposes:
Authentication: Cookies can store login credentials or session identifiers to keep users logged in as they navigate between pages or revisit a website.
Personalization: Websites use cookies to remember user preferences, such as language settings or display preferences.
Tracking: Cookies can be used for tracking user behavior and interests across websites, often for advertising and analytics purposes.
Shopping Carts: E-commerce websites use cookies to remember items in a user's shopping cart.

Q what is headers ?

ASn:: a header refers to a block of data at the begining of a data packet or message that contains 
important information about the packet contect format and how it should be processed

for example :: in networking and web communication http header are used to convey 
information about the request or resones being sent between a client (such as a web browser )
and a server these header include details such as the content type length caching instructions and authentication information


Q what is coustom Ip authorization ?
Ans::  --> the header X-CUSTOM-IP-Authorization" is not a stander HTTP header it appers to
be a custom header that you've included in your network request custom header are additional 
piece of infoprmation that can be added 
..--> the  name of the custom header X-custom-Ip-Authorization , "Implies that is related to authorization based on IP address
