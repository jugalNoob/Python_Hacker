Identify and exploit binary vulnerabilities.
Gain a basic understanding of how malware operates.
7. Cryptography Basics
Key Concepts:
Encryption (symmetric vs. asymmetric), hashing, and encoding.
Algorithms to Study:
AES, RSA, SHA, MD5.
Tools:
PyCryptodome library in Python to practice with encryption and decryption.
Goals:
Learn how data encryption and decryption work.
Understand how weak cryptography can be exploited.
8. Social Engineering and Human-Based Hacking
Social Engineering Techniques: Phishing, pretexting, baiting, and impersonation.
Key Tools:
SET (Social Engineering Toolkit): For phishing simulations.
Goals:
Conduct simulated social engineering attacks ethically.
Understand how to educate users to prevent falling for social engineering attacks.
9. Mobile and IoT Security
Mobile Security:
Study Android and iOS security fundamentals, APK reversing, and mobile app vulnerabilities.
IoT Security:
Understand the basics of IoT device architecture, common protocols (MQTT, CoAP), and vulnerabilities.
Tools:
Frida and Drozer for mobile app penetration testing.
Goals:
Perform vulnerability assessments on mobile and IoT devices.
Develop awareness of the unique challenges in securing these devices.
10. Network Forensics and Incident Response
Forensics Concepts: Memory analysis, log analysis, and network traffic analysis.
Tools:
Volatility: Memory forensics.
Splunk: For log management and analysis.
Goals:
Analyze data and logs to detect potential security incidents.
Develop an incident response plan for cyber attacks.
11. Participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) Competitions
CTF Platforms:
Hack The Box, TryHackMe, PicoCTF, and CTFtime.
Goals:
Apply hacking skills in a controlled environment.
Compete with and learn from other hackers.
12. Gain Certifications (Optional but Recommended)
Beginner Certifications:
CompTIA Security+: A good foundation in general security concepts.
Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH): Entry-level cert for ethical hacking.
Advanced Certifications:
OSCP (Offensive Security Certified Professional): Hands-on penetration testing certification.
OSCE (Offensive Security Certified Expert): Advanced exploitation certification.
Other Relevant Certifications:
CISSP for a more managerial approach, focusing on security policies and frameworks.
13. Develop Soft Skills
Reporting and Communication: Learn how to document vulnerabilities and explain them to non-technical stakeholders.
Ethics and Legal Knowledge: Understand the legalities of hacking, privacy laws, and ethical boundaries.
Research and Continuous Learning: Cybersecurity is ever-evolving, so always stay up-to-date with the latest trends and vulnerabilities.
14. Practice in Real-World Scenarios
Bug Bounty Programs:
Join programs on platforms like HackerOne, Bugcrowd, or Synack to gain real-world experience and potentially earn money for finding vulnerabilities.
Open-Source Contribution:
Contribute to or create open-source security tools on GitHub.
15. Specialization and Advanced Topics
As you gain experience, consider specializing in areas like:
Red Teaming: Offensive security to simulate real-world attacks.
Blue Teaming: Defensive security to protect networks and respond to attacks.
