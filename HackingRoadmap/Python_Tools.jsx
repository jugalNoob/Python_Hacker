Installation: pip install ropgadget
9. Automation and Scripting Utilities
Subprocess and OS: Python’s standard libraries for running system commands and file operations.

Usage: import os, subprocess
Threading and Multiprocessing: Standard libraries for multi-threading and parallel execution of tasks.

Usage: import threading, multiprocessing
Schedule: Automates task scheduling, useful for running scripts at specific intervals.

Installation: pip install schedule
10. Reporting and Documentation
Matplotlib: Visualization library to create charts, graphs, and plots of data.

Installation: pip install matplotlib
ReportLab: Generate PDFs, useful for creating structured vulnerability reports.

Installation: pip install reportlab
Jinja2: Template engine, useful for generating HTML reports from templates.

Each of these libraries and tools is powerful in 
its own right and can be combined to create custom,
 automated ethical hacking tools. By mastering these, you can create scripts for scanning, payload delivery, forensics, or even automated reporting. Practicing with them on legal, safe environments (like personal labs or secure online CTFs) will help in developing practical skills in ethical hacking.
